- 👋 Hi, I’m Navanshu
- 👀 I am passionate about solving problems and presenting the solutions. The problems may range from specific task like analyzing sale   price
      to maximize profits, or a broad topic like effects of new entrant in the market, or a simple chess game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and building projects around Analytics and Machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking for roles in Analytics, Consulting, or honestly anything that involves solving problems using Data and Strategy.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like doing Stand-up comedy.
