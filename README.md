- 👋 Hi, I’m Navanshu
- 👀 I like solving problems and presenting the solutions. The problems may range from specific task like analyzing sale price
      to maximize profits, or generic topic like effects of new entrant in the market, or a simple chess game.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning and building projects around Analytics and Machine learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Analytics, Consulting projects, or anything that aims to solve problems using Data and Strategy.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I did Stand-up comedy for a year.
